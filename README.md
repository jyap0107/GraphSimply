# GraphSimply
Simple graphing tool for graph theory applications.

Currently supports: Shortest path, BFS, DFS, checking for bipartitedness, and eulerian paths for unweighted and unweighted directed and undirected graphs.

In progress:
- Self loops and two edges between nodes in directed graphs.
- Customized coloring so users can visualize graph coloring.

Future updates may include:
- Automatic updating upon graph change.
- Saving graphs into image.
